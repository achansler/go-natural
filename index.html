        <h2>The power of American pine.</h2>
        <p>We started Go Natural because we believe in the healing power of pine needles. And not just any pine, but the Eastern White Pine tree, which is native to the US. The only problem? It’s really hard to find a good source of white pine, and it’s even harder to find it growing wildly, without any pesticides or chemicals. So we decided to change that.      
            Our mission when we began was simple: creating the best, freshest, most natural pine needle tea, picked and harvested in America and packed by American workers.      
            We’re lucky to live in New York State, which has an abundant source of wild Eastern White Pine growing across the Hudson Valley region. Each week, our team of American foragers goes on a foraging trip, coming back with bundles of wild pine. We then dehydrate them in small batches, which ensures that the nutrients are locked into the needles. Then after putting them into bags by hand, we ship them to you. 
            It’s not the easiest or cheapest way to make pine needle tea, but we believe it’s the right way.
            <p>
                So when you buy from Go Natural, you can be sure that not only are you getting a product made in America, but that you are supporting a small business employing American workers.

            <p>20 tea bags, 40g bag</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">American-made and packed by American workers:</span> Unlike other brands, we are the only company to source everything from the USA.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Wild-foraged:</span> Our pine needles are picked fresh from forests in upstate New York each week, and are never sprayed with pesticides.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">From the best pine trees:</span> We only pick our pine needles from the Eastern White Pine, which is the best pine tree to make pine needle tea because it has the highest amount of suramin and it's native to the USA.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">All natural biodegradable tea bags:</span> A lot of tea is packed in plastic-based tea bags and is coated with industrial chemicals. We decided against that--so our tea is packed in natural tea bags that are made of a biodegradable mesh that's derived from plant starch.</li>

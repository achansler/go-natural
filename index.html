            <div>
                <p>
                    Pine needles, especially from the Eastern White Pine tree, are packed with nutrients and natural properties that work with your body in some amazing ways. A few of the studied benefits of pine needle tea include:

        <h2>How we source it</h2>
        <p>We started Go Natural because we believe in the healing power of pine needles. And not just any pine, but the Eastern White Pine tree, which is native to the US. The only problem? It’s really hard to find a good source of white pine, and it’s even harder to find it growing wildly, without any pesticides or chemicals. So we decided to change that. Our mission when we began was simple: creating the best, freshest, most natural pine needle tea, picked and harvested in America and packed by American workers. We’re lucky to live in New York State, which has an abundant source of wild Eastern White Pine growing across the Hudson Valley region. Each week, our team of American foragers goes on a foraging trip, coming back with bundles of wild pine. We then dehydrate them in small batches, which ensures that the nutrients are locked into the needles. Then after putting them into bags by hand, we ship them to you. It’s not the easiest or cheapest way to make pine needle tea, but we believe it’s the right way.
            <p>
                So when you buy from Go Natural, you can be sure that not only are you getting a product made in America, but that you are supporting a small business employing American workers.
